The development of computer and technology allow the structure of a molecule and materials to be designed and simulated by its nature or character. In other words, the material can be designed according to the requirements of the user or applications. The chemistry has been cross-border areas because almost all areas of basic sciences such as biology, geology, agriculture, physics, materials science, manufacturing, chemical engineering and require chemistry knowledge.
