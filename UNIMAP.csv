Materials engineers are closely related to various types of key materials namely metals, polymers, rubber, ceramics, composites, electronics, bio-materials, semiconductors and superconductors. Materials engineering applies mathematical, scientific and engineering principles to understand the properties of materials in which the field forges the relationship between modern chemistry and physics, besides the engineering design and mathematical analysis."

In line with that, graduates are able to apply knowledge and skills to solve engineering-related problems. Chemical Engineers differ from the work of chemists, where Chemists perform on a small scale, while Chemical Engineers perform on a larger scale for industrial purposes.

The curriculum structure has been formed emphasizing on theoretical understanding and applied through laboratory practice, computer-assisted learning, workshop, industrial training and projects based on design or technology and engineering problem solving. Graduates have broad job prospects where the need for professional manpower in the field of chemical engineering is very high in line with the government's goal of developing the industrial field. It is estimated that Malaysia needs at least 200,000 engineers to achieve developed country status by 2020. Currently, there are only 70,000 engineers registered in the country."
